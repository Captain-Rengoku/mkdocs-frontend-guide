## **1.Understanding State in React**

### What is State?

- State is a built-in object in React that allows components to maintain and manage dynamic data.
- Unlike props, which are read-only and passed down from parent components, state is internal to a component and can be modified over time.
- Changes in state trigger re-renders, ensuring the UI stays in sync with the data.

### State vs Props

- **State**:
      - Holds dynamic data within a component and can change over time.
      - Can be modified using setState or useState
      - Local to the component
      - Trigger Rerenders.
- **Props**:
      - Data passed from parent to child and cannot be modified by the receiving component.
      - Read-only (immutable)
      - Passed from parent to child.
      - Trigger Rerenders only if parent re-renders

### Why State is Immutable

- State should never be modified directly in React.
- Instead, updates should be made using setState in class components or the useState hook in functional components.
- Directly mutating state can cause unpredictable UI behavior and may prevent React from properly detecting changes, leading to inefficient re-renders.

```jsx
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

const increment = () => {
  count++; // ❌ Direct mutation
};
```

```jsx
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

const increment = () => {
  setCount(count + 1); // ✅ Proper way to update state
};
```

---

## **2.useState Hook for State Management**

### Using useState to Handle Local State

- `useState` is a React hook that allows functional components to manage local state.
It returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function to update it.

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Count: {count}</button>
  );
}
```

- **Key Points:**
  - useState(0) initializes count with 0.
  - setCount is used to update count.
  - Always use the setter function rather than modifying state directly.

### Functional Updates in useState

- **Understanding Stale State Issue**
  - React does not update state immediately. Instead, it schedules updates and re-renders the component asynchronously.
  - If you update state using the current state value without considering the latest changes, you might end up with stale or incorrect values.

  ```jsx
  import { useState } from "react";
  
  function Counter() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
    const handleIncrement = () => {
    // stale value - a stale value is an outdated or old value of a variable
    // All the setCount calls below use the same stale value of `count`
    // because state updates in React are asynchronous and done by batched.
    // React batches these updates and only the last one takes effect — which is still `count + 1`
    setCount(count + 1);
    setCount(count + 1); // ❌ Doesn't work as expected    
    setCount(count + 1);
    setCount(count + 1);
    setCount(count + 1);
    // These 5 setCount will be one batch
    // To increment multiple times properly, use the functional form: setCount(prev => prev + 1)
    // also called updater function
    setCount(prev => prev + 1);
    // And this will be one batch
    setCount(count => count + 1);
    // And this will be one batch and should set the count as 3 from 0
    setCount(count + 1);
    // And this will overwrite all the previous setCounts and only the last setCount will be updated
    // so it will only add one and 0 will become 1
    };
  
    return <button onClick={handleIncrement}>Count: {count}</button>;
  }
  
  export default Counter;
  ```

  - When handleIncrement runs, setCount(count + 1) is called twice.
  - Since count holds the same value in both calls, both set it to 1 instead of 2.

- **How Functional updates help avoid stale state issues.**
  we use `setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);` to solve this issue

  ```jsx
  const handleIncrement = () => {
    setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
    setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1); // ✅ Correctly increments by 2
  };
  ```

  - The updater function `(prevCount => prevCount + 1)` receives the latest state.
  React batches updates and ensures each prevCount reflects the most recent state.

---

## **3.Class Component State vs Functional Component State**

### Managing State in Class Components

- In class components, state is managed using the `this.state` object and updated using the `this.setState` method. This approach requires binding methods when using event handlers.

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class Counter extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { count: 0 };
  }
  
  increment = () => {
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
  };
  
  render() {
    return <button onClick={this.increment}>Count: {this.state.count}</button>;
  }
}
```

### Managing State in Functional Components with Hooks

- Functional components use the `useState` hook to manage state, eliminating the need for `this.state` and making code cleaner and more concise.

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Count: {count}</button>
  );
}
```

### Migrating from Class to Functional Components

- Replace `this.state` with `useState` and `this.setState` with the state updater function.
- Remove the constructor and this references.
- Also no need for event binding atall.
- No need to use lifecycle methods (componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate) instead uses useEffect Hook.

---

## **4.State Updates and Batch Processing**

### setState Behavior and Batch Updates

- React optimizes performance by batching multiple state updates into a single render.
- This prevents unnecessary re-renders and enhances application efficiency.

```jsx
const handleClick = () => {
  setCount(count + 1);
  setCount(count + 1); // ❌ Only increments by 1, not 2
};
```

- React batches state updates in event handlers to optimize performance.
- When setCount(count + 1) runs twice, React sees them as the same state update and merges them.
- The component only re-renders once with the last state update.

React groups these updates into one batch, applying only the final computed state.

### Optimizing State Changes

- To correctly update state multiple times within an event handler, use the functional form of setState, which ensures updates are based on the most recent state.

```jsx
setCount(prev => prev + 1);
setCount(prev => prev + 1); // ✅ Correctly increments by 2
```

- The functional updater (prevCount => prevCount + 1) ensures each setCount call gets the latest state.
- React batches state updates but correctly applies them sequentially.

### How React 18 Improves State Updates

- Before React 18, React only batched state updates inside event handlers.
- State updates in asynchronous code (e.g., timeouts, promises) were processed individually, causing multiple re-renders.

```jsx
setTimeout(() => {
  setCount(count + 1);
  setCount(count + 1); // ✅ Used to trigger two re-renders before React 18
}, 1000);
```

- React 18 improves automatic batching of updates, reducing unnecessary renders.

```jsx
setTimeout(() => {
  setCount(prev => prev + 1);
  setCount(prev => prev + 1); // ✅ Now correctly increments by 2 in React 18
}, 1000);
```

## **5.Lifting State Up for Shared State Management**

- In React, lifting state up means moving state to the closest common ancestor of components that need to share it.
- This helps avoid redundant state and ensures consistent data flow.

### Why Lift State Up?

- Only store state in the closest common ancestor component if multiple components need access to it.
- ✅ Prevents duplicate state in multiple components.
- ✅ Ensures synchronized data across components.
- ✅ Simplifies state management by keeping it centralized.

### Sharing State Between Components

- Imagine two sibling components needing access to the same state.
- Instead of keeping separate state in each component, we lift it to a common parent.
  
- **Before: Separate State in Each Component (Problem)**

  ```jsx
  function ComponentA() {
    const [text, setText] = useState("");
    return <input value={text} onChange={(e) => setText(e.target.value)} />;
  }
  
  function ComponentB() {
    const [text, setText] = useState("");
    return <p>{text}</p>;
  }
  ```

- Issue: Both components have their own text state, leading to unsynchronized data.

- **After: Lifting State to a Common Parent (Solution)**

  ```jsx
  function Parent() {
    const [text, setText] = useState("");
  
    return (
      <div>
        <InputField value={text} onChange={setText} />
        <DisplayText value={text} />
      </div>
    );
  }
  
  function InputField({ value, onChange }) {
    return <input value={value} onChange={(e) => onChange(e.target.value)} />;
  }
  
  function DisplayText({ value }) {
    return <p>{value}</p>;
  }
  ```

- ✅ Now, both components share the same state from Parent, ensuring data stays in sync.

### When to Use Context API vs Lifting State Up

- Use lifting state up for local state sharing; use Context for global state needs.
- Choosing between lifting state up and the Context API depends on how widely the state is shared and how deep it needs to be passed in the component tree.

- Lifting State Up (For Local State Sharing)
      - ✅ Best for state shared between a few components that are closely related like sibling components.
      - ✅ Avoids unnecessary complexity by keeping state in the nearest common ancestor.
      - ✅ Prevents prop drilling for shallow component hierarchies.

- Context API (For Global or Deeply Nested State)
      - ✅ Useful when many components across different levels need access to the same state.
      - ✅ Eliminates prop drilling, making deeply nested components easier to manage.
      - ✅ Best for theme management, authentication, and global application state.

```jsx
import { createContext, useContext, useState } from "react";

// Create Context
const ThemeContext = createContext();

function App() {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState("light");

  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, setTheme }}>
      <Toolbar />
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
}

function Toolbar() {
  return <ThemedButton />;
}

function ThemedButton() {
  const { theme, setTheme } = useContext(ThemeContext);

  return (
    <button onClick={() => setTheme(theme === "light" ? "dark" : "light")}>
      Current Theme: {theme}
    </button>
  );
}
```

Best for: Large applications where state is shared across multiple components at different levels.

- **context api in a child component**
      - you cannot define a Context Provider inside a child component and then pass it up to a parent component.
      - React’s data flow is unidirectional (from parent to child), meaning that context providers should be defined at a higher level in the component tree.

- **Why Context API Must Be Defined in a Parent Component**
      - Context Providers Wrap Components
        - The Provider must be at a higher level to supply data to its children.
        - Child components can only consume context that is provided above them.
      - React’s Unidirectional Data Flow
        - Data flows down from parent to child, not the other way around.
        - A child component cannot provide context to a parent because the parent renders before the child.

---

## **6.Derived State from Props**

- Derived state from props refers to computing state based on received props rather than storing and managing it independently.
- This is useful when the component's state needs to be updated based on changes in props.

- Sometimes, a component receives props that influence its internal state.
- Instead of storing the prop directly as state (which can cause issues), we derive the state dynamically based on props.

### Avoiding Anti-Patterns

Avoid copying props into state unless transformation is required.

```jsx
function UserProfile({ name }) {
  const [userName, setUserName] = useState(name); // Anti-pattern
  
  useEffect(() => {
    setUserName(name);
  }, [name]); // Updating state when props change

  return <h2>{userName}</h2>;
}
```

- **Why is this an Anti-Pattern?**
- Redundant state: name is already available as a prop, so storing it in state is unnecessary.
- Unnecessary re-renders: When name changes, useEffect updates userName, causing a re-render that could be avoided.
Better Approach: Use Props Directly

```jsx
function UserProfile({ name }) {
  return <h2>{name}</h2>;
}
```

- No need for state since the value can be directly used from props.
- Avoids extra re-renders by eliminating unnecessary state updates.

### When to Derive State from Props

Derived state is useful when:

- The state requires transformation based on props.
- The state needs to be modified by user interactions but should reset when props change.

  ```jsx
  function PriceDisplay({ price }) {
    const formattedPrice = `$${price.toFixed(2)}`; // Derived state from props
    return <p>Price: {formattedPrice}</p>;
  }
  ```

- Here, price is transformed into a formatted string.
- No need to store formattedPrice in state because it can be computed directly from price.

### Memoization for Derived State

- If deriving state involves expensive calculations, memoization with `useMemo` can improve performance.

- **Expensive Computation without Memoization**

  ```jsx
  function LargeList({ items }) {
    const sortedItems = items.sort((a, b) => a.localeCompare(b)); // Sorting on every render
    return <ul>{sortedItems.map(item => <li key={item}>{item}</li>)}</ul>;
  }
  ```

- Problem: Sorting happens on every render, even if items hasn’t changed.

- **Optimized Approach with useMemo**
  Use `useMemo` to optimize expensive calculations.
  
  ```jsx
  import { useMemo } from 'react';
  
  function LargeList({ items }) {
    const sortedItems = useMemo(() => {
      return [...items].sort((a, b) => a.localeCompare(b));
    }, [items]); // Recomputes only when `items` changes
    
    return <ul>{sortedItems.map(item => <li key={item}>{item}</li>)}</ul>;
  }
  ```

Why useMemo Helps?

- Prevents unnecessary re-sorting on every render.
- Only recomputes when items changes, improving performance.

---

## **7.React Context API for Global State Management**

- The React Context API is a built-in way to manage global state without prop drilling.
- It allows you to share data across multiple components without passing props manually at every level.

Why Use Context API?

- ✅ Avoids prop drilling – No need to pass props through multiple components.
- ✅ Simplifies global state management – Ideal for themes, authentication, and user preferences.
- ✅ Built into React – No need for external libraries like Redux for simple state sharing.

### Creating and Using Context Providers

- **A Provider wraps your components and provides state to them.**

  ```jsx
  import { createContext, useState } from "react";
  
  // 1️⃣ Create a Context
  const ThemeContext = createContext();
  
  // 2️⃣ Create a Provider Component
  function ThemeProvider({ children }) {
    const [theme, setTheme] = useState("light");
  
    return (
      <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, setTheme }}>
        {children}
      </ThemeContext.Provider>
    );
  }
  
  export { ThemeContext, ThemeProvider };
  ```

- ✅ Now, any component inside `<ThemeProvider>` can access theme and setTheme.

- **To consume the context, use the useContext hook.**

  ```jsx
  import { useContext } from "react";
  import { ThemeContext } from "./ThemeProvider";

  function ThemedButton() {
    const { theme, setTheme } = useContext(ThemeContext);
  
    return (
      <button 
        onClick={() => setTheme(theme === "light" ? "dark" : "light")}
        style={{ background: theme === "light" ? "#fff" : "#333", color: theme === "light" ? "#000" : "#fff" }}
      >
        Toggle Theme
      </button>
    );
  }
  ```

- ✅ The button updates and reflects the theme without needing props!

- **To make sure all components can access the theme, wrap your app with `<ThemeProvider>`.**

  ```jsx
  import { ThemeProvider } from "./ThemeProvider";
  import ThemedButton from "./ThemedButton";

  function App() {
    return (
      <ThemeProvider>
        <ThemedButton />
      </ThemeProvider>
    );
  }

  export default App;
  ```

- ✅ Now, any component inside ThemeProvider can access the theme state.

### Avoiding Unnecessary Renders with useMemo

- By default, every time a provider's state updates, all consuming components re-render. To avoid unnecessary renders, use useMemo:
  
  ```jsx
  import { createContext, useState, useMemo } from "react";
  
  const ThemeContext = createContext();
  
  function ThemeProvider({ children }) {
    const [theme, setTheme] = useState("light");
  
    // Memoizing the context value
    const contextValue = useMemo(() => ({ theme, setTheme }), [theme]);
  
    return (
      <ThemeContext.Provider value={contextValue}>
        {children}
      </ThemeContext.Provider>
    );
  }
  
  export { ThemeContext, ThemeProvider };
  ```

- ✅ Reduces unnecessary re-renders and improves performance!

### When to Use Context vs Redux

- Use Context for simple small-scale global state like theme, auth, language and Redux for complex state logic.

---

## **8.Advanced State Management Patterns**

- As React applications grow, managing state efficiently becomes more complex.
- How to use advanced patterns like useReducer, custom hooks, and comparisons of state management libraries.

### State Reducers with useReducer Hook

- The `useReducer` hook is an alternative to useState, useful for managing complex state logic (e.g., forms, counters, state transitions).

Why Use useReducer Instead of useState?

- Better for complex state logic
- Helps when multiple state values are interdependent
- Provides predictable state updates

```jsx
import { useReducer } from "react";

const reducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "increment":
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case "decrement":
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    case "reset":
      return { count: 0 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

function Counter() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { count: 0 });

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {state.count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "increment" })}>+</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "decrement" })}>-</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "reset" })}>Reset</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

- ✅ Using useReducer keeps logic centralized and manageable.

### Using Custom Hooks for State Management

- Custom hooks allow us to encapsulate reusable state logic and make components cleaner.

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";

function useCounter(initialValue = 0) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(initialValue);

  const increment = () => setCount(c => c + 1);
  const decrement = () => setCount(c => c - 1);
  const reset = () => setCount(initialValue);

  return { count, increment, decrement, reset };
}

// Usage in a Component
function Counter() {
  const { count, increment, decrement, reset } = useCounter();

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>+</button>
      <button onClick={decrement}>-</button>
      <button onClick={reset}>Reset</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

- ✅ Now, useCounter can be reused in multiple components without rewriting logic.

### Comparison of Context API vs Redux vs Zustand

| Feature     | Context API | Redux     | Zustand   |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| Complexity  | Low         | High      | Medium    |
| Performance | Moderate    | Optimized | Optimized |
| Boilerplate | Low         | High      | Low       |

- ✅ Use Context API for small to medium applications (e.g., themes, auth).
- ✅ Use Redux for large, complex applications with shared state logic.
- ✅ Use Zustand for a simpler and scalable alternative to Redux.
