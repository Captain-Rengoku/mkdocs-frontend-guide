## **1. Installing Node.js & npm**

- **Downloading and Installing Node.js**

  - Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that enables running JavaScript outside the browser It is essential for React development. Follow these steps to install it:
  - Go to the official Node.js website: `https://nodejs.org/`
  - Download the latest LTS (Long-Term Support) version for stability.
  - Run the installer and follow the setup instructions.
  - Ensure you check the option to install npm (Node Package Manager).

  - **Verifying Installation**
    - Once installed, open the terminal and run: node -v
    - This should return the installed Node.js version.
    - To verify npm installation, run: npm -v
    - This should return the installed npm version.

  - **Understanding Node.js Package Manager (npm)**
    - npm is a package manager that comes with Node.js, used to install and manage JavaScript packages and dependencies for projects.
    - Common npm commands:
          - `npm init` - Initializes a new project.
          - `npm install <package>` - Installs a package.
          - `npm install -g <package>` - Installs a package globally.
          - `npm update` - Updates all packages.

## **2. Setting Up a React Project with Vite**

- **Creating and Running a New Project**
  - Vite is a modern frontend build tool that offers a fast and optimized development experience.

  - To create a new React project using Vite, run:
    - npm create vite@latest my-vite-app --template react
  - Navigate to the project directory:
    - cd my-vite-app
  - Install dependencies:
    - npm install
  - Then start the development server:
    - npm run dev

    By default, the app runs on `http://localhost:5173/`

- **Understanding Default Folder Structure**
`Folder Structure`

```txt
my-vite-app/
│-- node_modules/
│-- public/
│-- src/
│   ├── assets/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── App.jsx
│   ├── main.jsx
│-- .gitignore
│-- index.html
│-- package.json
│-- vite.config.js
```

`Key files and folders:`

- src/: Main source code for components and logic.
- public/: Static assets such as images and index.html.
- vite.config.js: Configuration file for Vite.
- index.html: The main HTML entry point.

`Customizing Vite Configuration`

- Vite provides flexibility through vite.config.js.
- You can modify settings like aliasing, plugins, and environment variables.

Example of aliasing paths in vite.config.js:

```txt
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      '@components': '/src/components',
    },
  },
});
```

## **3. Project Structure of a React App**

- **src, public, node_modules, package.json Explained**
  - src/: Contains React components, hooks, styles, and utility functions.
  - public/: Stores static files like images and fonts.
  - node_modules/: Installed dependencies.
  - package.json: Defines project metadata and dependencies.

- **Organizing Components, Hooks, and Utilities**
    Recommended folder structure:

```txt
my-vite-app/
│-- src/
│   │-- components/
│   │-- hooks/
│   │-- utils/
│   │-- styles/
│   └── App.jsx
```

- **Best Practices for Folder Structure**
  - A modular and reusable component refers to a self-contained, independent unit of code that can be used across different parts of a project or in multiple  projects without modification.
  - Use separate folders for utilities and hooks.
    - Utilities are general helper functions used for tasks like formatting, calculations, or API calls. They work in any JavaScript project.
    - Hooks are special functions in React that let functional components manage state and side effects.
    - Utilities are stateless and reusable across different projects.
    - Hooks are React-specific and used inside functional components to handle things like state (useState) or side effects (useEffect).
    - Example: A utility might format a date, while a hook manages a counter’s state in a React component.
    - Maintain styles in a dedicated folder.

## **4. Understanding package.json & node_modules**

- **Managing Dependencies**

    Dependencies are listed in package.json:

    ```txt
    "dependencies": {
      "react": "^18.0.0",
      "react-dom": "^18.0.0"
    }
    ```

    Install dependencies with: `npm install`

- **npm Scripts Overview**

    Common scripts in package.json:

    ```txt
    "scripts": {
      "dev": "vite",
      "build": "vite build",
      "preview": "vite preview"
    }
    ```

    Run a script with: npm run dev , npm run build , npm run preview

- **Peer Dependencies and Dev Dependencies**
      - `Dependencies` - Required for production.
      - `Dev Dependencies` - Required for development (--save-dev).
      - `Peer Dependencies` - Must be installed manually by the consuming project.

## **5. Running and Building a React Application**

- **Development Server and Build Process**
      - To start the development server: npm run dev
      - To build for production: npm run build

- **This generates an optimized dist/ folder.**

Using Environment Variables in React

- Vite uses .env files for environment variables:
      - VITE_API_URL=`https://api.example.com`
- Access it in your app:
      - const apiUrl = `import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL;`

---

## **6. Comparing Vite over CRA**

- **Benefits of Vite**
      - Faster startup due to esbuild pre-bundling.
      - Optimized builds with efficient tree-shaking.
      - Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for instant updates.
      - Smaller bundle sizes due to optimized dependency handling.
