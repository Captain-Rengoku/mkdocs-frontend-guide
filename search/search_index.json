What is React?","text":"<p>React is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications (SPAs) where a fast, interactive, and dynamic user experience is required. Developed and maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook), React allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently update the DOM using a virtual DOM.</p>"},{"location":"react/1.Introduction%20to%20React/#history-and-evolution-of-react","title":"History and Evolution of React","text":"<p>React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook, in 2011. It was first used in Facebook\u2019s News Feed and later in Instagram. The library was officially open-sourced in 2013, allowing developers worldwide to use and contribute to it.</p> <p>Key Milestones in React\u2019s Evolution:</p> <ul> <li>2013: React is open-sourced at JSConf US.</li> <li>2015: React Native is released, enabling React development for mobile apps.</li> <li>2016: Introduction of React Fiber, improving rendering performance.</li> <li>2017: React 16 is launched, bringing features like error boundaries and portals.</li> <li>2018: Introduction of React Hooks, enabling state management in functional components.</li> <li>2020: React 17 introduces gradual upgrades for better backward compatibility.</li> <li>2022-Present: React continues to evolve with improved Concurrent Rendering, React Server Components(RSC), and Suspense.</li> </ul> <p>Concurrent Rendering in React: Concurrent Rendering is a React feature that allows the UI to remain responsive by rendering updates asynchronously. Instead of blocking the main thread, React can pause, prioritize, or abandon rendering tasks based on user interactions and system workload.</p> <p>Traditional React rendering is synchronous, meaning that once a render starts, it cannot be interrupted. If a heavy computation or large UI update happens, it can cause lag or freeze the UI.</p> <p>Concurrent rendering solves this by:</p> <ul> <li>\u2705 Interrupting non-urgent renders when a high-priority update (like user input) occurs.</li> <li>\u2705 Scheduling renders based on priority to enhance responsiveness.</li> <li>\u2705 Avoiding UI freezes by spreading rendering work over multiple frames.</li> </ul> <p>React Server Components (RSC) Explained: React Server Components (RSC) are a new feature that allows React components to be rendered on the server instead of the client. This helps reduce the JavaScript bundle size and improves performance by delivering pre-rendered HTML from the server to the browser.</p> <p>What is Suspense? Suspense is a React feature that lets components \"wait\" for some asynchronous operation (like data fetching) before rendering. It helps manage loading states efficiently and improves the user experience by displaying fallback UI while waiting for data.</p>"},{"location":"react/1.Introduction%20to%20React/#core-philosophy-of-react","title":"Core Philosophy of React","text":"<p>React is built around a few key principles that make it powerful and efficient:</p> <ul> <li>Declarative UI: React components describe what the UI should look like, and React efficiently updates the DOM to match this description.</li> </ul> <pre><code>function Greeting() {\n  return &lt;h1&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/h1&gt;;\n}\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>Component-Based Architecture: React applications are made up of independent, reusable components that manage their own state and behavior.</li> </ul> <pre><code>function Button() {\n  return &lt;button&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt;;\n}\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>Virtual DOM for Performance: Instead of updating the real DOM directly, React uses a Virtual DOM to minimize performance bottlenecks.</li> </ul> <p>When a change occurs, React compares the Virtual DOM with the previous version and updates only the necessary parts.</p> <ul> <li>Unidirectional Data Flow: React follows a top-down (one-way) data flow, making it easier to track and manage state changes.</li> </ul> <p>Data is passed via props from parent to child components.</p> <ul> <li>React Hooks for State Management: With Hooks (introduced in React 16.8), functional components can handle state and lifecycle methods.</li> </ul> <pre><code>import { useState } from \"react\";\n\nfunction Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  return (\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      &lt;p&gt;Count: {count}&lt;/p&gt;\n      &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; setCount(count + 1)}&gt;Increment&lt;/button&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  );\n}\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"react/1.Introduction%20to%20React/#open-source-community-and-contributions","title":"Open-Source Community and Contributions","text":"<p>React has a thriving open-source ecosystem, with active contributors from Facebook, individual developers, and large companies.</p> <p>Key Contributions and Community Initiatives:</p> <ul> <li> <p>React Repository on GitHub: One of the most starred repositories on GitHub.</p> </li> <li> <p>React DevTools: A browser extension for debugging React applications.</p> </li> <li> <p>Third-Party Libraries: Popular libraries like Redux, React Router, and Next.js enhance React\u2019s capabilities.</p> </li> <li> <p>Conferences &amp; Meetups: Events like React Conf bring the global developer community together.</p> </li> <li> <p>Meta\u2019s Role: Facebook (Meta) maintains React and regularly releases updates, ensuring long-term support.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"react/1.Introduction%20to%20React/#2-features-and-benefits-of-react","title":"2.

Reduces boilerplate, handles async logic, integrates DevTools &amp; middleware. <ul> <li>2\ufe0f\u20e3 Store Setup</li> </ul> Concept Description <code>configureStore</code> Creates the Redux store with preconfigured settings. <code>combineReducers</code> Combines multiple slices (used if needed). <code>Provider</code> Component Makes the store accessible to React components. <ul> <li>3\ufe0f\u20e3 Slices: State + Actions + Reducers</li> </ul> Concept Description <code>createSlice</code> Auto-generates actions and reducers from slice definition. <code>name</code> Name of the slice (used in action types). <code>initialState</code> Initial state of the slice. <code>reducers</code> Synchronous state mutation logic. <code>actions</code> Auto-generated action creators from reducer keys. <ul> <li>4\ufe0f\u20e3 Accessing State and Dispatching Actions</li> </ul> Concept Description <code>useSelector</code> Read data from the Redux store. <code>useDispatch</code> Dispatch actions from components. Selectors Pure functions to select parts of the state. <ul> <li>5\ufe0f\u20e3 Async Logic with <code>createAsyncThunk</code></li> </ul> Concept Description <code>createAsyncThunk</code> Handles async logic and auto-generates action types. <code>pending</code> Triggered when the request starts. <code>fulfilled</code> Triggered when the request succeeds. <code>rejected</code> Triggered when the request fails. <code>extraReducers</code> Used to handle these action states inside the slice. <ul> <li>6\ufe0f\u20e3 RTK Query (Built-In Data Fetching)</li> </ul> Concept Description <code>createApi</code> Defines endpoints for fetching/mutating server data. Auto Cache Automatically caches and invalidates queries. Auto Hooks Generates hooks like <code>useGetPostsQuery</code>. Realtime Updates Uses polling or WebSockets with <code>refetchOnMountOrArgChange</code>. <ul> <li>7\ufe0f\u20e3 Entity Adapter</li> </ul> Concept Description <code>createEntityAdapter</code> Manages normalized state with built-in CRUD helpers and selectors. <code>setAll</code>, <code>addOne</code> Immutable helper functions to manage entity collections. <code>getSelectors</code> Returns optimized selectors like <code>selectById</code>, <code>selectAll</code>. Normalized State Improves performance and simplifies updates. <ul> <li>8\ufe0f\u20e3 Middleware (Built-In and Custom)</li> </ul> Middleware Purpose Redux Thunk Enables <code>createAsyncThunk</code> for async logic. Included by default in RTK. Listener Middleware React to specific actions outside reducers (side effects). RTK Query Middleware Manages caching, invalidation, polling, and subscriptions. <ul> <li>9\ufe0f\u20e3 Best Practices</li> </ul> Practice Why Co-locate logic per feature Maintainable, modular structure. Keep state normalized Easier updates and caching. Keep slices focused Smaller, maintainable reducer logic. Use RTK Query for async data Handles caching and status automatically. <ul> <li>\ud83d\udd1f Common RTK Techniques</li> </ul> Technique Description Selectors + useSelector Extract state efficiently with memoization. useDispatch + Thunks Trigger async or complex actions from components.

What is JSX?","text":"<p>JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to HTML. It is used with React to describe the structure of the user interface in a declarative manner. JSX is not a requirement for using React, but it makes the code more readable and expressive.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Why JSX Exists</p> <ul> <li>JSX simplifies the process of writing UI components by providing a syntax that resembles HTML, making it easier to visualize the structure of the UI. Under the hood, JSX is compiled to JavaScript calls to <code>React.createElement()</code>, which ultimately generates the virtual DOM elements.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Writing JSX Syntax</p> <ul> <li>JSX allows developers to write HTML-like structures directly within JavaScript. A basic JSX snippet looks like this:</li> </ul> <pre><code>const element = &lt;h1&gt;Hello, JSX!&lt;/h1&gt;;\n</code></pre> <p>It can also include nested elements:</p> nested elements<pre><code>const element = (\n  &lt;div&gt;\n    &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to JSX&lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;JSX makes writing UI code easier!&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n);\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>JSX Compilation Process     JSX is not valid JavaScript, so it must be compiled before it can be executed by the browser. Babel, a popular JavaScript compiler, transpiles JSX into JavaScript functions that create React elements:</p> <pre><code>const element = React.createElement(\"h1\", null, \"Hello, JSX!\");\n</code></pre> <p>Babel automatically transforms JSX into these function calls, ensuring compatibility with JavaScript environments.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"react/3.Understanding%20jsx/#2-jsx-syntax-and-expressions","title":"2.

You define queries and mutations using hooks like <code>useQuery</code> and <code>useMutation</code>. This leads to cleaner and more organized code.</li> <li>Mutation (useMutation): Used to send data to the server (e.g., POST, PUT, DELETE). Supports optimistic updates.</li> <li>Query Keys: Unique identifiers for queries; essential for caching and invalidation.</li> <li>Query Client: A central manager for all queries/mutations. Configures global settings like retry count and cache time.</li> <li>Automatic Caching: React Query includes a built-in cache that stores query results. It automatically updates data when mutations occur, ensuring your UI remains consistent.</li> <li>Background Data Sync: It can automatically refetch data in the background, keeping your data fresh without manual intervention.</li> <li>Pagination and Infinite Scrolling: React Query provides utilities for handling pagination and infinite scrolling effortlessly.</li> <li>Optimistic Updates: You can implement optimistic updates with ease, making your app feel more responsive.</li> <li>DevTools: Visual debugging tool to inspect the query cache, query states, and performance.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"reactapi/14.5.2.React%20Query/#comparison-with-redux-swr","title":"Comparison with Redux &amp; SWR","text":"Feature React Query Redux SWR Purpose Server state mgmt Global app &amp; server state mgmt Server state mgmt Data Caching \u2705 Built-in \u274c Manual \u2705 Built-in Background Refetching \u2705 Yes \u274c No \u2705 Yes DevTools \u2705 Yes \u2705 (via Redux DevTools) \u274c No (community-based) Boilerplate Minimal High Minimal Optimistic Updates \u2705 Yes \u274c Manual \ud83d\udea7 Limited Pagination Support \u2705 Yes \u274c Manual \ud83d\udea7 Basic support Learning Curve Medium High Low <p>Summary: React Query is ideal when your app heavily interacts with remote data and you want to avoid over-engineering with global state libraries like Redux.
